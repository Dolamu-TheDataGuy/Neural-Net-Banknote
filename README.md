# Neural-Net-Banknote
<img src = './Images/net.jpg'/>
A neural network code that uses a banknote dataset to predict the authenticity of a currency note. The dataset consist of features such as variance, Kurtosis, skew, entropy and class. A simple neural net with an architecture of an input layer consisting of four features (<b>variance</b>,<b>Kurtosis</b>,<b>skew</b>,</b>entropy</b>), an hidden layer, and an output layer (<b>class</b>) was modeled for this purpose.
